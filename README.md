# The Default Stack

The goal of this repo is to provide you with a basic stack that will allow you
to build any application without thinking much about the deployment.

It comes with basic services like:

* A database - Postgres
* A reverse proxy - Nginx or Traefik or Caddy?
* A SMTP server - Postfix
* A key value store - Redis
* An object storage - Minio
* An example to deploy a static website
* An example to deploy a Python application

Work in progress
